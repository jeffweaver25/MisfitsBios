  <h2>Managing Bios - READ THIS!</h2>

  <p>
    Click 
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddP0dBTxkz8Vn7Ow0WCIDsStlD_9WKFJioY-vx6LVse_l9mg/viewform?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Submit a Bio</a> 
    to <b>create</b> a bio. You can not use this link to update your bio (see below). This is a Google form — just fill it out.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you submit your bio, be sure to save the URL of your form. You will need this if you want to update your bio later. (Click <u>Edit your response</u> and bookmark that page)"
    Don’t worry — if you lose it, DM <span class="highlight">FireJeff</span> on Discord and I can send it to you.
    <br /><br />
    Similarly, if you want to delete your bio, just DM <span class="highlight">FireJeff</span> to have it deleted.
  </p>

  <h3>Images (READ THIS!)</h3>
  You can upload up to 3 images, but you must be logged in to your Google account to submit images.
